----------
# Added in hunting behavior

> Ants get stuck around own hill, cannabalize eachother
> Ants still stuck around individual holes
> Hunting behavior not being executed correctly

* Need to implement ant defense scheme
* Need to optimize code, could be faster/more efficient
* Need to implement enemy ant hill capping behavior



REV B - 11/30/2011
----------
# Fixed incorrect pathToNode updates
# Fixed timeout issue

> Ants get stuck around own hill, cannabalize eachother
> Ants still stuck around individual holes

* Need to implement hunter ants
* Need to implement ant defense scheme
* Need to optimize code, could be faster/more efficient



REV A - 11/30/2011
----------
> pathToNode seems to update individually for each ant
> Timeout (could be related to above)
> Ants get stuck around own hill (again, could be related to first point)
> Some ants get stuck in individual holes surrounded by water.

* Need to implement hunter ants
* Need to implement ant defense scheme
* Need to optimize code, could be faster/more efficient
