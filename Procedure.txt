AI Challenge Procedure
---------------------------

* Determine location
* Determine Purpose
	-> Compile total number of ants and their purposes
	-> Each job function has a specific proportion of ants allocated
		>> Determined dynamically
		>> Gatherer starts at 100%
		>> Once ant threshold reached (enough food), begin to
		   allocate Explorers
		>> Once enemy encountered, remember position, allocate Hunters
		>> Group hunters and move as swarm towards last enemy position
		>> If explorers have not found enemy hill, hunters begin 
		   aggressive breadth-first search for hill.  If area has been
		   explored, Explorer ants mark and Hunters ignore
		>> Explorers will gather food if nearby and attack ants if
		   need be
		>> Eventually Gatherer jobs disappear and Hunters/Explorers
		   become majority
		>> Any gatherers that get unassigned return to hill and begin
		   to protect it.  New gatherers join the mob protecting the
		   hill.  If multiple hills, new Gatherers just protect hill
		   they spawned on.
		>> If Food production drops below threshold after Gatherers
		   begin their conservative behavior, start aggressive food
		   search
* Perform tasks
	-> Retrieve grid weight
		>> 0 means has not been visited
		>> high numbers mean recently visited (starts at 100)
		>> low numbers mean hasn't visited in awhile
		>> -100 marks enemy hills
		>> -1 marks enemy spoted
	-> Move towards grid with least weight
		>> If path blocked, move towards next grid with least weight.
	-> If ant in adjacent grid and has same job function, follow
	-> If ant on hill, move off.
	-> If gatherer and see enemy, move in opposite direction
	-> If explorer and see enemy, mark grid
		>> If more than one friendly ant in sight, attack
		   else run away
	-> If hunter and see enemy, attack, call all nearby hunters to area
	-> If any ant and see food, gather.
	-> If enemy near home hill, make nearby ants hunters and seek out
	   threat.  Swarm home hill to protect from further threats.
	-> If enemy hill found and not destroyed , remember path, optimize 
           path with explorers, attack with hunters.
	-> Priority: Gather food, Protect Home Hill, Attack enemy hill,
	   attack enemy, explore.
	-> At end of turn, give new weight to each grid ant is on.
